Resource requests and limits are optional parameters specified at the container level. These settings help ensure that an applications run efficiently, prevent resource contention, and maintain overall cluster stability.
1. Resource requests:
     Resource requests defines the minimum amount of CPU & Memory resources a pod need to run.
     when we specify a resource request k8 ensures that the pod is scheduled with at least the resources defined in the request.
     example- 
          resources:
            requests:
              memory: "512Mi"
              cpu: "0.5"

2. Resource limits:
     Resource limit defines the maximum amount of CPU and Memory resources that can be allocated to that pod.
     If a container tries to exceed these limits, Kubernetes will either throttle it (for CPU) or terminate it (for memory).
     example-
          resources:
            limits:
              memory: "1Gi"
              cpu: "1"

Resource limits and requests are essential for:

- Preventing resource exhaustion: Avoid overloading and protect other applications.
- Optimizing resource utilization: Efficient allocation and avoid underutilization.
- Improving cost management: Predictable costs and avoid overspending.
- Enforcing Quality of service: Prioritize critical applications and control bursting.
- Facilitating autoscaling: Accurate scaling based on demand.
